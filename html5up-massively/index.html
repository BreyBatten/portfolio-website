									<p>Lambda School is an online, fully remote technical school with a focus on projects in a group setting that mimics the product development cycle and 
										teaches students the skills they need to become Full-Stack developers. Included with the curriculum is a capstone project, where students
										work on a team to build a full-stack application over several weeks. Students go through the full development cycle, from product planning and user research to deployment.

									<p>Becoming the leader of a group of people has had some of the biggest impacts on who I am as a person today. It has taught me how to be an effective communicator,
